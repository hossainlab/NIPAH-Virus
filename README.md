# NIPAH Virus Transmission in Bangladesh

Nipah virus is a zoonotic virus belonging to the *Paramyxoviridae* family and the Nipah henipavirus species within the Negarnaviricota phylum. It is primarily transmitted from animals to humans and can also spread through contaminated food. Fruit bats, known as flying foxes, serve as the natural reservoir for Nipah virus. The virus was first identified in 1999 during an outbreak in Malaysia and Singapore, which affected both pigs and humans.


Nipah virus infections can manifest with symptoms ranging from none to fever, cough, headache, and shortness of breath. The infection can be severe and often results in a high mortality rate. There have been multiple outbreaks of Nipah virus infection in regions like North East Africa and Southeast Asia.

Efforts to understand and control Nipah virus include research into its transmission, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. The World Health Organization (WHO) provides a fact sheet on Nipah virus, offering valuable information on signs, symptoms, transmission, and more. Understanding the virus's dynamics and taking preventive measures are essential in managing the risk of Nipah virus infections
